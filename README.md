# Production-level Shiny app development

Here, we share the materials for our submitted proposal for a Shiny tutorial at [useR 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/).

## Overview
How to transform your idea into a production-ready app?

In this interactive tutorial (in Spanish), we will delve into several key aspects that will allow you to organize, ease, and accelerate the development of your project into a professional Shiny app.

This tutorial will cover 
- Structure and good practices to  start and maintain a project (renv, config, unit testing, linters).
- Modularization (R6 classes, Shiny Modules, wahani modules/box).
- Performance optimization (profvis, lobstr).
- Database management (DBI, pool). 

For each of these topics, there will be an interactive practice session to gain hands-on experience using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
