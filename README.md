# Production-level Shiny app development

Materials and slides for our submitted proposal for a Shiny tutorial at [useR 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/).

## Overview
How to transform your idea into a production-ready app?

In this interactive tutorial (in Spanish), we will delve into several key aspects that will allow you to organize, ease, and accelerate the development of your project into a professional Shiny app.

This tutorial will cover 
- Structure and good practices to start and maintain a project (renv, config, unit testing, linters).
- Modularization (R6 classes, Shiny Modules, klmr box).
- Performance optimization and data management (profvis, benchmark, DBI, pool) 

For each of these topics, there will be an interactive practice session to gain hands-on experience using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
